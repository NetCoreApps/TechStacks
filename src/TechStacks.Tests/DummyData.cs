Redis 3.2.7     Released Tue Jan 31 16:21:41 CET 2017
=====================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: This release fixes important security and correctness
                      issues. It is especially important to upgrade for Redis
                      Cluster users and for users running Redis in their laptop
                      since a cross-scripting attack is fixed in this release.

Main bugs fixes and improvements in this release:

1. MIGRATE could incorrectly move keys between Redis Cluster nodes by turning
   keys with an expire set into persisting keys. This bug was introduced with
   the multiple-keys migration recently. It is now fixed. Only applies to
   Redis Cluster users that use the resharding features of Redis Cluster.

2. As Redis 4.0 beta and the unstable branch already did (for some months at
   this point), Redis 3.2.7 also aliases the Host: and POST commands to QUIT
   avoiding to process the remaining pipeline if there are pending commands.
   This is a security protection against a ""Cross Scripting"" attack, that
   usually involves trying to feed Redis with HTTP in order to execute commands.
   Example: a developer is running a local copy of Redis for development
   purposes. She also runs a web browser in the same computer. The web browser
   could send an HTTP request to http://127.0.0.1:6379 in order to access the
   Redis instance, since a specially crafted HTTP requesta may also be partially
   valid Redis protocol. However if POST and Host: break the connection, this
   problem should be avoided. IMPORTANT: It is important to realize that it
   is not impossible that another way will be found to talk with a localhost
   Redis using a Cross Protocol attack not involving sending POST or Host: so
   this is only a layer of protection but not a definitive fix for this class
   of issues.

3. A ziplist bug that could cause data corruption, could crash the server and
   MAY ALSO HAVE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS was fixed. The bug looks complex to
   exploit, but attacks always get worse, never better (cit). The bug is very
   very hard to catch in practice, it required manual analysis of the ziplist
   code in order to be found. However it is also possible that rarely it
   happened in the wild. Upgrading is required if you use LINSERT and other
   in-the-middle list manipulation commands.

4. We upgraded to Jemalloc 4.4.0 since the version we used to ship with Redis
   was an early 4.0 release of Jemalloc. This version may have several
   improvements including the ability to better reclaim/use the memory of
   system.

This can occur because the process is waiting for disk I/O to finish, it's true. But that's not the only reason. It can occur because the process is waiting for other kinds of I/O, like network.

Since the redis-benchmark process sends commands to the Redis server, it also receives the replies. Generating the key and value names doesn't take much time and transmitting to the server doesn't either. So a larger portion of the time will be spent waiting for the reply from the server. At the particular instant that ps captures the process's state, it's more likely to be in the state that's waiting for a reply than in the middle of transmitting a command.

I think that's all it is - redis-benchmark behaving normally."
